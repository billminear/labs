# Labs

Resources for various networking labs I've built using various platforms.

## yaml_view.py
Pretty prints the dictionary representation of a YAML file. Quick and easy
way to verify a YAML file is structured as you think it is.

Most, if not all, of the labs have an associated YAML file defining some 
infrastructure variables. Whether the YAML is intended to be parsed or 
strictly information, I like to practice where I can. This allows me to 
quickly verify the structure.
```sh
# Usage.
python3 yaml_view.py file.yaml
